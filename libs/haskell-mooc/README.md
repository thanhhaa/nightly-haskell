Information about types and functions
Next you should become familiar with these commands for querying information about Haskell types and functions.

`:doc <arg>` – Show the documentation for a Haskell type, etc., right in the REPL. Typical type names will start with a capital letter, such as Int, Bool, String and other user-defined types.

`:info` – Queries information about a type, typeclass, value, function, or operator. I often use it to query unfamiliar functions.

`:instances` – Shows a list of all typeclass instances that are available for a type.

`:kind` – Queries the kind of a type.

`:type` – Queries the type of a value or function.
